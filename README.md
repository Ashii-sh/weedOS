# weedOS
This is a quickstart script that installs my personalized XFCE4 DE onto any Debian 12 System.
Its based on and is similar to HeteroChromia420's XQSS (XFCE4 Quickstart Script)

# How to use?

Clone this repo and run the script

> git clone 'https://github.com/Ashii-sh/weedOS/'
> cd weedOS/
> sudo chmod +x quickstart-script.sh
> ./quickstart-script.sh

And thats it~!
