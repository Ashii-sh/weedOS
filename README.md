# weedOS
This is a quickstart script that installs my personalized XFCE4 DE onto any Debian 12 System.
It's based on and is similar to HeteroChromia420's XQSS (XFCE4 Quickstart Script).

# How to use?

Clone this repo and run the script;

```
git clone 'https://github.com/Ashii-sh/weedOS/'
cd weedOS/
sudo chmod +x quickstart-script.sh
./quickstart-script.sh
```

...and thats it~!

# Legal stuff
idc how you use this script tbh lol
